//
// THE ROCK
//
// Turning used to open the app switcher. That made the knob useless for anything else:
// every app that wanted a turn of its own had to first be given the knob by a button press,
// and this button takes real force to click. So the knob had one job and the button had all
// the others, which is backwards for a device whose only control is a knob.
//
// Now a turn belongs to whatever app is on screen, and the switcher is opened by ROCKING the
// knob: a quick turn one way immediately followed by a quick turn back. Ordinary use never
// looks like that. Scrolling a list back and forth does, but slowly, and it is the speed that
// separates the gesture from someone changing their mind, which is why the window is tight.
//
// EITHER direction fires. Left-then-right only was the rule until 2026-08-29, on the reasoning
// that one fixed order halves the accidental reversals for no cost in performing it. There was
// a cost: a hand reaching for the menu does not decide which way to go first, so half the
// attempts did nothing. See knob.cpp for what carries the margin now, and UX-011.
//
// There is no fallback way in, by choice. If this proves unreliable on real hardware the
// window is the thing to tune, and if it cannot be made reliable then a fallback should come
// back rather than the tuning being fudged.
